## Description
Given an array S of n integers, are there elements a, b, c in S such that a + b + c = 0? Find all unique triplets in the array which gives the sum of zero.

Elements in a triplet (a,b,c) must be in non-descending order. (ie, a ≤ b ≤ c)

The solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.


For example, given array S = {-1 0 1 2 -1 -4}, A solution set is:

(-1, 0, 1)
(-1, -1, 2)


Input
[1,0,-1,-1,-1,-1,0,1,1,1]

Expected
[[-1,0,1]]

### ***Hint***:

Divide to 2-Sum question, but notice the replicated answer

--> sort the origin array S,
--> do not run into the 2-sum fun

## Answer

```python
from sets import Set
class Solution:
    """
    @param numbers: Give an array numbers of n integer
    @return: Find all unique triplets in the array which gives the sum of zero.
    """
    def threeSum(self, numbers):
        # write your code here
        target = 0
        answer = []
        
        s = Set()
        for i in range(0, len(numbers)-2):
            lookup = []
            new_t = target - numbers[i]
            for n in numbers[i+1:]:
                if new_t - n in lookup:
                    c = tuple(sorted((numbers[i], n, new_t - n)))
                    s.add(c)
                lookup.append(n)
        return list(s)
```
