# Longest Continuous Increasing Subsequence

## Description

Give an integer arrayï¼Œfind the longest increasing continuous subsequence in this array.

An increasing continuous subsequence:

Can be from right to left or from left to right.
Indices of the integers in the subsequence should be continuous.

Example
<br>For [5, 4, 2, 1, 3], the LICS is [5, 4, 2, 1], return 4.
<br>For [5, 1, 2, 3, 4], the LICS is [1, 2, 3, 4], return 4.

## Answer:


```python
class Solution:
    """
    @param A: An array of Integer
    @return: an integer
    """
    def longestIncreasingContinuousSubsequence(self, A):
        # write your code here
        
        currentLR = 1
        currentRL = 1
        maxLen = min(1, len(A))
        
        for i in range(0, len(A)-1):
            if A[i] < A[i+1]:
                currentLR += 1
                currentRL = 1
                maxLen = max(maxLen, currentLR)
            elif A[i] > A[i+1]:
                currentLR = 1
                currentRL += 1
                maxLen = max(maxLen, currentRL)
        
        return maxLen
